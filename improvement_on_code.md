This script is a well-structured, production-ready Lambda function for managing EC2 snapshots. It includes error handling, logging, metrics, and accommodates large numbers of snapshots through batch processing. The dry run mode and exemption tagging provide flexibility in its operation.
Key features of this script include:

Environment variable validation
Pagination for retrieving snapshots
Batch processing to prevent timeouts
Custom CloudWatch metrics for monitoring
Comprehensive error handling and logging
SNS notifications for important events
Dry run mode for testing
Exemption of snapshots based on tags

This script demonstrates best practices for AWS Lambda functions, including separation of concerns (each function does one thing), error handling, and observability through logging and metrics.
